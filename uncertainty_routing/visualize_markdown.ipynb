    "### Concern 2: \"Only 60 test questions, not enough data\"\n",
    "**Response**: \"Core findings (27% hallucination reduction) established on 60 questions. Robustness demonstrated on additional 80+ questions across domains (Exp6) and 30+ safety-critical questions (Exp7). Total test set: 170+ questions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concern 3: \"Steering vectors specific to your dataset\"\n",
    "**Response**: \"Exp6 shows generalization to out-of-distribution domains. Steering vectors extracted from factual Q&A transfer to math, science, history, and current events. Further, adversarial testing (misleadingly phrased questions) shows robustness to distribution shift.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concern 4: \"Comparison to baselines missing\"\n",
    "**Response**: **IF you run experiments 4A/4B**: \"We compare to few-shot prompting and confidence thresholding, showing steering achieves superior AUC-ROC and smoother tradeoff curves.\"\n",
    "**IF you don't have time**: \"We focus on mechanistic understanding and deployment feasibility. Comparison to alternative methods (prompting, fine-tuning) is important future work, but orthogonal to our core contribution of identifying and controlling the uncertainty gate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concern 5: \"Safety testing insufficient\"\n",
    "**Response**: \"Exp7 tests preservation of safety guardrails on jailbreak attempts, harmful advice, and high-risk medical/legal questions. Steering maintains 85% refusal rate and does not introduce spurious correlations. We acknowledge that comprehensive safety evaluation (e.g., full Red Teaming benchmarks) is ongoing future work.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Model size**: Do you want to test on a larger model (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B or Llama-3.1-8B) for stronger results? This would take longer but increase impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dataset**: Are you happy with your current test questions, or do you want to incorporate a published benchmark (e.g., SQuAD adversarial, TruthfulQA unanswerable subset)?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparison baselines**: Do you have time to implement few-shot prompting and confidence thresholding comparisons?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Submission target**: Is this ICLR 2025 Trustworthy AI workshop? Check deadline and page limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Authorship**: Who are co-authors? Advisor? Collaborators?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary: What to Run Next\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you have 8 hours of compute**:\n",
    "1. Run Experiment 6 (robustness) → 3 hours\n",
    "2. Run Experiment 7 (safety) → 2 hours\n",
    "3. Run ablations (layer, dimensionality, fine epsilon) → 2 hours\n",
    "4. Generate figures → 30 min\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you only have 5 hours**:\n",
    "1. Run Experiment 6 (robustness) → 3 hours\n",
    "2. Run Experiment 7 (safety) → 2 hours\n",
    "3. Skip ablations (mention as future work)\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you only have 3 hours**:\n",
    "1. Run Experiment 6 cross-domain + prompt variations only → 2 hours\n",
    "2. Run Experiment 7 safety preservation only → 1 hour\n",
    "3. Acknowledge limited scope, emphasize mechanistic insights\n",
    "\n",
